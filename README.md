**Heart Failure Prediction - Digital Health Program**



Problem Statement
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of death worldwide, often due to factors like arterial blockages and organ damage. The task is to design a digital health program that uses real-time vital signs data to predict the likelihood of fatal cardiovascular events. By analyzing patients’ data, the goal is to create a tool that helps healthcare providers monitor vital signs and intervene early, reducing the risk of death from CVDs. The solution will support clinicians in making timely, data-driven decisions to prevent fatal outcomes.



Structure of the Program
The program consists of three main modules:

1. Loading Module
This module handles loading the dataset from a CSV file and processes it into a nested dictionary, which is returned by the functions for further analysis.
2. Query Module
This module contains functions for querying the dataset to generate various statistics and insights.
3. User Interface Module
This module provides an interactive interface for users to query the system and display results in a user-friendly format.



Relationship Between the Modules
The Loading Module supplies the dataset into a dictionary.
The Query Module performs computations and analysis on the data.
The User Interface Module interacts with the user, displays results, and takes input to query the system.




Instructions on How to Execute the Program
Ensure you have a Python interpreter installed on your computer.
The dataset file should be available in the same directory as the application files.
The program consists of three main modules: Loading Module, Query Module, and User Interface Module.
Run the Program:
Execute the program by running the main script, and interact with the system through the user interface.



Insights from Data Analysis
Older Patients and Fatal Heart Failure: Older patients are more likely to experience fatal heart failure. The average age of those who died (65.21) was higher than the dataset’s general average age (60.83).
Follow-Up Periods: Patients with longer follow-up periods did not die, suggesting that effective medical care and early hospital visits are critical. Patients should be encouraged to visit hospitals regularly for proper monitoring.
Age and Diabetes: The age most affected by diabetes is 60 years. Patients approaching this age should focus on managing sugar levels by reducing sugary foods and increasing exercise.
Smoking, Diabetes, and High Blood Pressure: The relationship between smoking, diabetes, and high blood pressure is not significant. Other lifestyle changes should be focused on for diabetes prevention.
Heart Failure Deaths: Deaths due to heart failure are not solely caused by high blood pressure. Many patients without high blood pressure also died, indicating other contributing factors.
Reflections
Proficiency in Data Analysis: I gained proficiency in querying and analyzing data, which deepened my understanding of programming concepts such as loops, iterations, conditionals, and data structures.
Working with Data Structures: I worked with lists and dictionaries to analyze the dataset, enhancing my skills in logic development, data handling, and error management.



Conclusion
This project involved developing a system to analyze cardiovascular disease data, aimed at helping healthcare providers monitor patients' vital signs. It included three key modules:

The Loading Module for importing data,
The Query Module for statistical analysis, and
The User Interface Module for user interaction.
The system enables healthcare providers to query and analyze critical patient data, such as age, blood pressure, and diabetes, to identify patterns and trends. This can inform clinical decisions and improve patient care, ultimately contributing to better management of cardiovascular diseases.
